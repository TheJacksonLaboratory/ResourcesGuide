This document provides an overview of the various computational resources we have at the carter Lab and how to get started with them, as well as some best-practice guidelines for promoting reproducibility. This is not meant to be a comprehensive tutorial, but more of a continuously-evolving road map. To contribute please use the github repository. You’re welcome to provide any feedback by either opening an issue on github or contacting annat.haber@jax.org.
