# ResourcesGuide
This document provides an overview of the various computational resources we have at the Carter Lab and how to get started with them, as well as some best-practice guidelines for promoting reproducibility. This is not meant to be a comprehensive tutorial, but more of a continuously-evolving road map. Feel free to contribute and provide feedback either through github or by contacting annat.haber@jax.org.
