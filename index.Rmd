title: "Computational Resources Guide"

This document provides an overview of the various computational resources we have at the Carter Lab and how to get started with them, as well as some best-practice guidelines for promoting reproducibility. This is not meant to be a comprehensive tutorial, but more of a continuously-evolving road map. You're welcome to contribute and/or provide any feedback either through the [github repository](https://github.com/TheJacksonLaboratory/ResourcesGuide) or by contacting annat.haber@jax.org.
